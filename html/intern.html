							Rockwell Collins Inc is a large United States-based international company headquartered in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, primarilly providing avinonics and information technology systems and services to governmental agencies and aircraft manufacturers. I worked here as a associate program manager which was to associate program manager to coordinate different programs. I learned two most important things here. One thing is how to communicat with other colleague efficiently and to get materials and information you needed on time. The other thing is that customer is the first thing you need to consider when doing a project or program. Just like the motto of Rockwell says Building Trust Everyday. We trust our customers and our customers trust us!

							1. Discontinue product line two
							<span class="wording">
								Product line two is a very old-fashion avonics system, just like the panels you see in some old plane. This system was desined 40 years ago and only has basic panels but not even display screens. So we decided to discontinue this product line, we won't produce any part of products of this product line. But there are a lot of problems may be casued by it. Because this product is very cheap, just 1.5 millions, there are many aircrafts still using it.  Many models of Bombardier, Airbus, Boeing, Embraer and Dassault will be involved in this process. I must guarantee that our customer will not be influenced.

							2. Analyzed possible reasons for No Fault Found problem.
							<span class="wording">
								This problem has occured for 12 years. Sometime, flight control unit doesn't work when pilots are flying. But when it is returned to Rockwell Collins, nothing went wrong when tested. Thousands cases occured every year. I was given a large excel form with all data and wrote some python code to cluster it and gave some possible reasons.
